\usage{
getConceptReference(
  connection = NULL,
  connectionDetails = NULL,
  conceptIds = NULL,
  resultsDatabaseSchema = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{(optional) An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{connectionDetails}{(optional) An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{conceptIds}{(optional) A vector of integers corresponding to conceptids of interest.}

\item{resultsDatabaseSchema}{(optional) The databaseSchema where the results data model 
of cohort diagnostics is stored. This is only required when 
\code{connectionDetails} or \code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} 
is provided.}
}
\value{
The function will return a tibble data frame object.

\description{
Get concept information
}
\details{
Note: The output of this function may be used to create plots or tables. This function relies 
on data available in Cohort Diagnostics results data model. The function will use one of the two
methods to connect to the results data model, 1) database mode, and 2) in-memory mode.

Database mode: In this mode, R will look for the results data model in a remote relational dbms. The 
database system should be one of the databases supported by DatabaseConnector package. If 
either \code{connectionDetails} or \code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} parameters are
populated with an argument during a function call, the connection gets set to database mode. 

In-memory mode: If both \code{connectionDetails} and \code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} are 
parameters have a NULL argument then query will be in-memory mode. R will now expect and check
for a data frame object available in R's memory, as required for the function. The object should be
an object specificed in Cohort Diagnostics results data model.

Objects in R's memory are expected to follow camelCase naming conventions (see HADES), while objects 
in a relational database system are expected to follow snake-case naming conventions.
