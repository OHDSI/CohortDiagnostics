\usage{
runVisitContextDiagnostics(
  connectionDetails = NULL,
  connection = NULL,
  cdmDatabaseSchema,
  tempEmulationSchema = NULL,
  cohortDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,
  vocabularyDatabaseSchema = vocabularyDatabaseSchema,
  cohortTable = "cohort",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To emulate temp 
tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables can be created.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your cohort table resides. Note that for SQL Server,
this should include both the database and schema name, for example
'scratch.dbo'.}

\item{vocabularyDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your OMOP vocabulary data resides. This is 
commonly the same as cdmDatabaseSchema. Note that for 
SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'vocabulary.dbo'.}

\item{cohortTable}{Name of the cohort table.}

\item{cohortIds}{A vector of one or more Cohort Ids to compute visit context for.}

\item{cdmVersion}{The version of the OMOP CDM. Default 5. (Note: only 5 is supported.)}
}
\description{
This function returns the types of visits experienced by persons in the cohort in 
relation to cohort start date.
