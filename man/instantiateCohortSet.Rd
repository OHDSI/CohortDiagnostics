\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{vocabularyDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your OMOP vocabulary data resides. This is 
commonly the same as cdmDatabaseSchema. Note that for 
SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'vocabulary.dbo'.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has write
privileges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your cohort table resides. Note that for SQL Server,
this should include both the database and schema name, for example
'scratch.dbo'.}

\item{cohortTable}{Name of the cohort table.}

\item{cohortIds}{Optionally, provide a subset of cohort IDs to restrict the
construction to.}

\item{packageName}{The name of the package containing the cohort definitions. Can be left NULL if 
\code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} have been specified.}

\item{cohortToCreateFile}{The location of the cohortToCreate file within the package. Is ignored if 
\code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} have been specified. The
cohortToCreateFile must be .csv file that is expected to be read into 
a dataframe object identical to requirements for \code{cohortSetReference} argument. 
This csv file is expected to be encoded in either ASCII or UTF-8, if not, an 
error message will be displayed and process stopped.}

\item{baseUrl}{The base URL for the WebApi instance, for example:
"http://server.org:80/WebAPI". Can be left NULL if 
\code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} have been specified.}

\item{cohortSetReference}{A data frame with four columns, as described in the details. Can be left NULL if 
\code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} have been specified.}

\item{generateInclusionStats}{Compute and store inclusion rule statistics?}

\item{inclusionStatisticsFolder}{The folder where the inclusion rule statistics are stored. Can be
left NULL if \code{generateInclusionStats = FALSE}.}

\item{createCohortTable}{Create the cohort table? If \code{incremental = TRUE} and the table
already exists this will be skipped.}

\item{incremental}{Create only cohorts that haven't been created before?}

\item{incrementalFolder}{If \code{incremental = TRUE}, specify a folder where records are kept
of which definition has been executed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with cohort counts
}
\description{
This function instantiates a set of cohort in the cohort table, using definitions that are fetched from a WebApi interface.
Optionally, the inclusion rule statistics are computed and stored in the \code{inclusionStatisticsFolder}.
}
\details{
Currently two ways of executing this function are supported, either 
(1) [Package Mode] embedded in a study package, assuming the cohort definitions are stored in that package using the \code{ROhdsiWebApi::insertCohortDefinitionSetInPackage}, or 
(2) [WebApi Mode] By using a WebApi interface to retrieve the cohort definitions.

When using this function in Package Mode: Use the \code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} to specify
the name of the study package, and the name of the cohortToCreate file within that package, respectively

When using this function in WebApi Mode: use the \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} to specify how to 
connect to the WebApi, and which cohorts to fetch, respectively.

Note: if the parameters for both Package Mode and WebApi Mode are provided, then Package mode is preferred.

The \code{cohortSetReference} argument must be a data frame with  the following columns:
\describe{
\item{referentConceptId}{A standard omop concept id that serves as the referant phenotype definition for the cohort Id.}
\item{cohortId}{The cohort Id is the id used to identify  a cohort definition. This is required to be unique. It will be used to create file names. It is recommended to be (referrentConceptId * 1000) + a number between 3 to 999}
\item{webApiCohortId}{Cohort Id in the webApi/atlas instance. It is a required field to run Cohort Diagnostics in WebApi mode. It is discarded in package mode.}
\item{cohortName}{The full name of the cohort. This will be shown in the Shiny app.}
\item{logicDescription}{A human understandable brief description of the cohort definition. This logic does not have to a 
fully specified description of the cohort definition, but should provide enough context to help user understand the
meaning of the cohort definition}
}
