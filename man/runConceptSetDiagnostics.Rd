  connection = NULL,
  connectionDetails = NULL,
  tempEmulationSchema = NULL,
  cdmDatabaseSchema,
  vocabularyDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,

}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To emulate temp 
tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables can be created.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{vocabularyDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your OMOP vocabulary data resides. This is 
commonly the same as cdmDatabaseSchema. Note that for 
SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'vocabulary.dbo'.}

\item{cohorts}{A dataframe object with required fields cohortId, sql, json, cohortName}

\item{cohortIds}{Optionally, provide a subset of cohort IDs to restrict the
diagnostics to.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your cohort table resides. Note that for SQL Server,
this should include both the database and schema name, for example
'scratch.dbo'.}

\item{exportDetailedVocabulary}{(optional) Default TRUE. Do you want to export from source site details of
from all vocabulary tables including concept_ancestor, concept_relationship,
concept_synonym etc. This is useful if you want to review the impact
of the vocabulary used in the data source on cohort definitions, and
compare it to the vocabulary used by other data sources or reference. 
Please set to FALSE to reduce file size and speed up process - as exporting
vocabulary and generating premerged file/deduplication takes significant processing
time. If set to FALSE then only 'concept' table  is exported. If set to TRUE (Default)
then "concept", "concept_ancestor", "concept_class", "concept_relationship", "concept_synonym", "domain", "relationship"
and "vocabulary" are exported.}

\item{keepCustomConceptId}{(Optional) Default FALSE. Do you want to keep concept id above 2 billion.
Per OMOP conventions any conceptId >= 2 billion are considered site specific
custom value that are not shipped as part of default OMOP vocabulary tables.}

\item{cohortTable}{Name of the cohort table.}
}
\description{
Runs concept set diagnostics on a set of cohorts. For index event breakdown,
the cohorts need to be instantiated.
