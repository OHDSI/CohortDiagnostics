\arguments{
\item{packageName}{The name of the package containing the cohort definitions. Can be left NULL if 
\code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} have been specified.}

\item{cohortToCreateFile}{The location of the cohortToCreate file within the package. Is ignored if 
\code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} have been specified. The
cohortToCreateFile must be .csv file that is expected to be read into 
a dataframe object identical to requirements for \code{cohortSetReference} argument.}

\item{baseUrl}{The base URL for the WebApi instance, for example:
"http://server.org:80/WebAPI". Can be left NULL if 
\code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} have been specified.}

\item{cohortSetReference}{A data frame with four columns, as described in the details. Can be left NULL if 
\code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} have been specified.}

\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has write
privileges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{cohortIds}{Optionally, provide a subset of cohort IDs to restrict the
diagnostics to.}

\item{conceptCountsDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your concept counts table resides. Note that
for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'scratch.dbo'. Ignored if
\code{conceptCountsTableIsTemp = TRUE}.}

\item{conceptCountsTable}{Name of the concept counts table. This table can be created
using the \code{\link{createConceptCountsTable}}.}

\item{conceptCountsTableIsTemp}{Is the concept counts table a temp table?}

\item{exportFolder}{The folder where the output will be exported to. If this folder
does not exist it will be created.}

\item{databaseId}{A short string for identifying the database (e.g. 'Synpuf').}

\item{databaseName}{The full name of the database.}

\item{databaseDescription}{A short description (several sentences) of the database.}

\item{runIncludedSourceConcepts}{Generate and export the source concepts included in the cohorts?}

\item{runOrphanConcepts}{Generate and export potential orphan concepts?}

\item{minCellCount}{The minimum cell count for fields contains person counts or fractions.}
}
\description{
Runs  cohort diagnostics on all (or a subset of) the cohorts, but using external concept counts. The external counts 
must have the following columns:

\describe{
\item{concept_id}{The source or target concept ID.}
\item{concept_count}{The number of records having the concept.}
\item{concept_subjects}{The number of unique persons having the concept.}
}
}
\details{
Currently two ways of executing this function are supported, either 
(1) [Package Mode] embedded in a study package, assuming the cohort definitions are stored in that package using the \code{ROhdsiWebApi::insertCohortDefinitionSetInPackage}, or 
(2) [WebApi Mode] By using a WebApi interface to retrieve the cohort definitions.

When using this function in Package Mode: Use the \code{packageName} and \code{cohortToCreateFile} to specify
the name of the study package, and the name of the cohortToCreate file within that package, respectively

When using this function in WebApi Mode: use the \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortSetReference} to specify how to 
connect to the WebApi, and which cohorts to fetch, respectively.

Note: if the parameters for both Package Mode and WebApi Mode are provided, then Package mode is preferred.

The \code{cohortSetReference} argument must be a data frame with  the following columns:
\describe{
\item{referentConceptId}{A standard omop concept id that serves as the referant phenotype definition for the cohort Id.}
\item{cohortId}{The cohort Id is the id used to identify  a cohort definition. This is required to be unique. It will be used to create file names. It is recommended to be (referrentConceptId * 1000) + a number between 3 to 999}
\item{webApiCohortId}{Cohort Id in the webApi/atlas instance. It is a required field to run Cohort Diagnostics in WebApi mode. It is discarded in package mode.}
\item{cohortName}{The full name of the cohort. This will be shown in the Shiny app.}
\item{logicDescription}{A human understandable brief description of the cohort definition. This logic does not have to a 
fully specified description of the cohort definition, but should provide enough context to help user understand the
meaning of the cohort definition}
}
