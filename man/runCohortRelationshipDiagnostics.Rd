\usage{
runCohortRelationshipDiagnostics(
  connectionDetails = NULL,
  connection = NULL,
  cohortDatabaseSchema = NULL,
  cdmDatabaseSchema,
  tempEmulationSchema = NULL,
  cohortTable = "cohort",
  targetCohortIds,
  comparatorCohortIds,
  relationshipDays,
  observationPeriodRelationship = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your cohort table resides. Note that for SQL Server,
this should include both the database and schema name, for example
'scratch.dbo'.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To emulate temp 
tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables can be created.}

\item{cohortTable}{Name of the cohort table.}

\item{targetCohortIds}{A vector of one or more Cohort Ids for use as target cohorts.}

\item{comparatorCohortIds}{A vector of one or more Cohort Ids for use as feature/comparator cohorts.}

\item{relationshipDays}{A dataframe with two columns startDay and endDay representing periods of time to compute relationship}

\item{observationPeriodRelationship}{Do you want to compute temporal relationship between target cohort and observation period table?}
}
\description{
Given a set of cohorts, get temporal relationships between the
cohort_start_date of the cohorts.
