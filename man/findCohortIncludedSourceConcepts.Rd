findCohortIncludedSourceConcepts(
  connectionDetails = NULL,
  connection = NULL,
  cdmDatabaseSchema,

  baseUrl = NULL,
  webApiCohortId = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connection} is
provided.}

\item{connection}{An object of type \code{connection} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{connect}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package. Can be left NULL if \code{connectionDetails}
is provided, in which case a new connection will be opened at the start
of the function, and closed when the function finishes.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has write
privileges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{baseUrl}{The base URL for the WebApi instance, for example:
"http://server.org:80/WebAPI". Needn't be provided if \code{cohortJson} and
\code{cohortSql} are provided.}

\item{webApiCohortId}{A vector of one Cohort Ids as in the source webApi/Atlas.}

\item{cohortJson}{A character string containing the JSON of a cohort definition. Needn't be
provided if \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortId} are provided.}

\item{cohortSql}{The OHDSI SQL representation of the same cohort definition. Needn't be
provided if \code{baseUrl} and \code{cohortId} are provided.}

\item{byMonth}{Compute counts by month? If FALSE, only overall counts are computed.}

\item{useSourceValues}{Use the source_value fields to find the codes used in the data? If not,
this analysis will rely entirely on the source_concept_id fields instead.
Note that, depending on the source data and ETL, it might be possible for
the source_value fields to contain patient-identifiable information by
accident.}
}
\value{
A data frame with source codes, with counts per domain how often the code was encountered in the
CDM.
}
\description{
This function first extracts all concept sets used in a cohort definition. Then, for each concept
set the concept found in the CDM database the contributing source codes are identified.
}
