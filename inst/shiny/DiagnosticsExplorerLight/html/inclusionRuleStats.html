<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A table showing the number of subject that match specific inclusion rules in the cohort definition. Note that this table will be empty if no inclusion rules have been specified.</p>

<p>The table contains the following columns:
<ul>
<li>Sequence: The order in which the inclusion rules are applied to the cohort.</li>
<li>Name: The name of the inclusion rule.</li>
<li>Meet: The number of cohort entries that meet the entry event definition and the specific inclusion rule indicated in the row.</li>
<li>Gain: The number of cohort entries that would be gained if this inclusion rule was dropped.</li>
<li>Total: The number of cohort entries meeting the entry event definition. In other words, the number of cohort entries before applying any of the inclusion rules.</li>
<li>Remain: The number of cohort entries remaining after applying the specific inclusion rule, and all preceding rules.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>You can select a database in the side bar to see the inclusion rule statistics observed in that database.</p>
<p>Select the cohort to explore in the side bar.</p>

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are there inclusion rules that nobody meets in a database? For example, requiring a specialist visit that is not recorded in a specific database.</li>
<li>Are there inclusion rules that have no effect in a database? For example, requiring no occurrence of a prior disease code that is not recorded in a database.</li>
<li>Are there inclusion rules that drastically reduce the population? In this case we might worry about generalizability. For example, if we require a diagnostic procedure, and only a small fraction meets this criteria, we may wonder if this identifies a special population that differs from the overall population in significant ways.</li>
</ul>
