<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A table showing the number of cohort entries and unique subjects per cohort per data source. Because one person can have more than one cohort entry, the number of entries can be higher than the number of persons.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<p>You may select multiple data sources in the side bar to see counts from different data sources side-by-side.</p>

<h4>What to look for</h4>
<ul>
<li>Are there cohorts that are empty in some data sources?</li>
<li>Are the relative counts (relative to the other cohorts in the same data source) comparable across data sources? Note that the color bars show the relative counts.</li>
<li>Are the cohorts of expected and sufficient size? For example, if we want to study the effect of an exposure, a rule-of-thumb is that we require at least 2,500 in the exposure cohort.</li>
</ul>
