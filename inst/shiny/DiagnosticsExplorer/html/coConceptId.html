<h3>Co Concept Id</h3>
<p>Given a selected concept id present on index date, the co-occurring concept id is present in the same person either on the same date, or some number of specified days +/- of the index date. The co-occurrence in this case is defined as presence in the same person of the concept id on a date in relation to the presence of the selected concept id. </p>

<p>The purpose of this diagnostics is to help us understand what codes are always present together. e.g. it would make sense for mapped concepts to be present with standard concepts, but how about another standard (or a non-standard concept) that is appears to be semantic related to the main clinical idea - but we are not sure if it truly meets the clinical idea? </p>

<p>Example: If we are building a cohort for Acute Myocardial infarction and are unsure if we want to include the concept id "4108678 - Hemopericardium due to and following acute myocardial infarction" as part of entry event criteria (for concerns of index date misclassification - i.e. persons with Hemopericardium FOLLOWING acute myocardial  infarction, we can use Co-Concept Id to determine what fraction of all the 4108678 Concept Id co-occur among persons with the concept id that are more semantically precise such as "312327 - Acute Myocardial infarction". If we find that majority of 4108678 are present in persons with 312327, then it would be good justification to consider not including 4108678. </p>
