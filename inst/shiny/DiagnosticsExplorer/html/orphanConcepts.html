<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A table showing the (source) concepts observed in the database that are <em>not</em> included in a concept set of a cohort, but maybe should be. The following logic is used to indentify concepts that might be relevant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given a concept set expression, find all included concepts.
<li>Find all names of those concepts, including synonyms, and the names of source concepts that map to them.</li>
<li>Search for concepts (standard and source) that contain any of those names as substring.</li>
<li>Filter those concepts to those that are not in the original set of concepts (i.e. orphans).</li>
<li>Restrict the set of orphan concepts to those that appear in the CDM database as either source concept or standard concept.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Subjects column contains the number of subjects in the entire database that have the specific concept. This count is <em>not</em> restricted to only those people in the cohort. Source concepts are identified in the _source_concept_id fields of the Common Data Model, (e.g. drug_source_concept_id) and are used to identify the specific source codes used in a database. Standard concepts are found using the _concept_id fields (e.g. drug_concept_id), and use the same coding system across all databases.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>You can select a database in the side bar to see the concepts and counts observed in that database.</p>
<p>Select the cohort and the specific concept set within that cohort to explore in the side bar.</p>

<h3>What to look for</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are there concepts that are not included in the concept but should be? Note that the provided list likely contains many false positives.</li>
</ul>
