<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A table showing the occurrence of concepts in relation to index date of the cohort. Filtering the tables by resolved concept_ids of the concept sets in 
the cohort definition may provide insights on which concept_id likely triggered the cohort entry. 

<h3>How was this calculated?</h3>
We counted the occurrence of each concept_id (number of persons, number of records) with the concept_id for every day, seperately, starting -40days prior to the index date to + 40 days after the index date. These computation was performed seperately for every CDM table and the maximum of person/record count across all tables was captured. If a conceptId had a low subject count (defined as min cell count * 10 ~ commonly 50, it was removed) - to reduce file size of the exported object and to enhance privacy, except if the concept_id was part of the concept set expression of the cohort definition AND it occurred on index date of the cohort. </p>

<h3>Intepretation</h3>
This diagnositic is useful to understand the occurrence of concept_id in relation to index date (starting - 40 days to + 40 days.).

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>You can select multiple databases in the side bar to see counts from different databases side-by-side.</p>
<p>Select the cohort to explore in the side bar.</p>

<h4>Concept Co-occurrence diagnostics</h4>
Given a selected concept_id what other concept_ids co-occurred with the selected concept_id on a certain number of days relative to index date (commonly 0 days). You can also f
<li> How many times does the selected concept_id occur in relation to the other concept_id's (alone, or in combination)
<li> Observe a 3-D matrix of the relationship between the selected concept_id.

<h4>Filter by Domain</h4>
Filter the concept_id by domain, eg. maybe you want to filter to the visit domain to understand visit context.

<h4>Filter by one or more concept set</h4>
Select one or more from the available concept-set (you are not limited the concept-set in the cohort being diagnosed i.e. you can select a concept set from across cohort definitions) - to filter the concepts in the table. Maybe combined with other filters.

<h4>Temporal Diagnostics</h4>
Given one or more selected concept_ids, you can visualize the temporal trend of the concept_id starting -40 to +40days in relation to the index date. 
- Is there a temporal relationship between index date and the concept_id i.e. does the index date become an inflection point (index date misclassification bias)


<h3>What to look for</h3>
<h4>Simple</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is one concept unexpectedly dominating? For example, if our cohort identifies exposure to drugs in a class, but we notice almost everyone enters the cohort based on a single drug, we may wonder whether our results will generalize to the class.</li>
<li>Are the highest ranking concepts different across databases? For example, is everyone in one database initiating high-dose prescriptions, and everyone in another database low-dose prescriptions? 
</ul>


<h4>Advanced</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you are interested in a non-standard concept_id that you are debating if it should be included in your definition. Would observing that more than 90% of the counts of th non-standard concept_id commonly occurrs on the same day as a standard concept_id that is already in your current cohort definition change your thinking on how to build the cohort definition? </li>
