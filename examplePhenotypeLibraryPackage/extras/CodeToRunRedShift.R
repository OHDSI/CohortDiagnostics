JMDC data includes membership status of the insured people and claims data provided by insurers under contract (e.g. patient-level demographic information, inpatient and outpatient data inclusive of diagnosis and procedures, and prescriptions as dispensed claims information). Claims data are derived from monthly claims issued by clinics, hospitals and community pharmacies; for claims only the month and year are provided however prescriptions, procedures, admission, discharge, and start of medical care as associated with a full date.\nAll diagnoses are coded using ICD-10. All prescriptions refer to national Japanese drug codes, which have been linked to ATC. Procedures are encoded using local procedure codes, which the vendor has mapped to ICD-9 procedure codes. The annual health checkups report a standard battery of measurements (e.g. BMI), which are not coded but clearly described."
