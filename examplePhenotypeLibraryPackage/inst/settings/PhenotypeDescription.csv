27918000,Eosinophilic esophagitis,27918,"Overview: This is a chronic, immune/antigen-mediated, esophageal disease characterized clinically by symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammationPresentation: Adults and teenagers frequently present with dysphagia and food impactions.
